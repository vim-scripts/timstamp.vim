*timstamp.txt*  Global plugin for automated time stamping - v0.95

The timstamp general plugin provides automated time-stamping functionality.

1. General		    |timstamp_general|
2. Specification format	    |timstamp_specformat|
3. Default specs	    |timstamp_default_specs|
4. Control variables	    |timstamp_control|

==============================================================================

1. General						*timstamp_general*

Whenever a file is written, this plugin will look for 'Time-stamp lines'
amongst the first and last lines of the file to be written. If any of these
lines contain e.g. ' Time stamp:' or 'Last change:', the plugin will update
these lines before writing the file.

The plugin is fully controlled by the user. It does provide two standard
'Time-stamp line' specifications as well as their replacement spec. The user
can add additional values as well as remove the default values.

The plugin and its documentation file can be installed as described under
|add-global-plugin| and |add-local-help|. Do not forget to run |:helptags|.

==============================================================================

2. Specification format					*timstamp_specformat*

The specification format for a time-stamp line consists of the {pat} and {sub}
parts required to build the desired substitute command. These {pat} and {sub} 
parts must be separated by a "!" character.

An examplespec may clarify this: "( Last changed:\).*$!\1 %Y %b %d".
The {pat} part instructs the plugin to look for any line that ends on
' Last changed: ...'.

The {sub} part is passed on to |strftime()|, which (at least at the time I am
writing this) translates "%Y %b %d" into "2002 Aug 11". Of course, these would
be the values at the time of the plugin execution, which is the moment before
writing the file. Any % tokens known by your version of |strftime()| can be 
used.
    
Additionally, some # tokens have been defined by the plugin. These are
replaced by their corresponding value after |strftime()| processing and 
before performing the actual substitutions:

    #f	filename    |timstamp_filename|
    #h  hostname    |timstamp_hostname|
    #H  Hostname    |timstamp_Hostname|
    #n  username    |timstamp_username|
    #u  userid	    |timstamp_userid|

#f  filename						*timstamp_filename*

    The #f token is replaced by the filename of the current buffer. This is a
    name without any path components.

#h  hostname						*timstamp_hostname*

    The #h token is replaced by the hostname of the current vim process. 
   
    The user can specify the desired value with the glabal variable
    g:timstamp_hostname. If that variable does not exist, the value of the
    $HOSTNAME environment variable will be used. If there is no $HOSTNAME, the
    output of the hostname() function is used. However, only the last word
    returned by that function is preserved. The platform type of qualifier
    (e.g. PC) is not kept.

#H  Hostname						*timstamp_Hostname*

    The #H token is also replaced by the hostname. However, the platform
    qualifier is not removed.

#n  username						*timstamp_username*

    The #n token will be replaced by the user name. This will be obtained from
    the g:timstamp_username variable if it exists. Otherwise, it is
    initialised from the $USERNAME environment variable.    

#u  userid						*timstamp_userid*

    The #u token will be replaced by the userid. This will be obtained from
    the g:timstamp_userid variable if it exists. Otherwise, it is
    initialised from the $LOGNAME environment variable. 
    
==============================================================================

3. Default specs				    *timstamp_default_specs*

The plugin defines two default specs, which can be overwritten by the user:

    Last Change Spec   |timstamp_last_change_spec|
    Time Stamp spec    |timstamp_time_stamp_spec|
    
3.1. Last Change Spec				*timstamp_last_change_spec*
	
    The last change spec has following default value:

    '\( Last \?\(changed\?\|modified\):\).*$!\1 %Y %b %d' 
	
    which can be overruled by providing a different value in the 
    g:timstamp_1 variable.

    The {pat} part is '\( Last \?\(changed\?\|modified\):\).*$'. This will 
    process lines containing ' Last changed', ' Last modified' or its 
    variations.

    The {sub} part is '\1 %Y %b %d'. This will preserve the ' Last ...:' 
    string and replace the remainder with the current 4 digit year, 
    the short month name and the day of month. 

    This file contains a 'Last Change' line at |timstamp_examples|.
	
3.2. Time Stamp spec				    *timstamp_time_stamp_spec*

    The time stamp spec is a bit more complex:

	'\( Time[- ]\?stamp:\).*$!\1 <#f %a %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S #u #h>'

    and can be overruled by defining the global g:timstamp_2 variable.

    The {pat} part is shorter: '\( Time[- ]\?stamp: \)<.*>$'. It will trigger 
    on lines containing ' Time-stamp', ' Time stamp' or ' Timestamp'
    immediately followed by a ':'.

    The {sub} part is '\1 <#f %a %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S #u #h>'. This will 
    preserve the ' Time...:' string, and replace the remainder of the line 
    with e.g. ' <timstamp.txt Sun 2002/08/11 13:03:01 guivho BTM4BZ>'. Please
    refer to the |timstamp_specformat| above for the # tokens.

    This file contains a 'Time stamp' line at |timstamp_examples|.

==============================================================================

4. Control variables					*timstamp_control*

The plugin can be fully controlled by the user. Each of the internal variables
that control the operation, can be overruled by providing a corresponding
global value.

    g:timstamp_1, 
    g:timstamp_2, 
    g:timstamp_...	    |timstamp_specs|
    g:timstamp_automask	    |timstamp_automask|
    g:timstamp_hostname	    |timstamp_hostname|
    g:timstamp_Hostname	    |timstamp_Hostname|
    g:timstamp_ignorecase   |timstamp_ignorecase|
    g:timstamp_language	    |timstamp_language|
    g:timstamp_modelines    |timstamp_modelines|
    g:timstamp_userid	    |timstamp_userid|
    g:timstamp_username	    |timstamp_username|

4.1. g:timstamp_1, g:timstamp_2, g:timstamp_...		    *timstamp_specs*

The |timstamp_default_specs| section has described the two default specs
provided by the plugin. If the user is happy with those two specs, no entry is
required in the .vimrc file.

However the user may overrule these default values by defining a g:timstamp_1
and / or a g:timstamp_2 variable, e.g:

    :let g:timstamp_1='\( Last change:\).*$!\1 %A %Y %b %d'
    
if the user would always want to include the day of the week as in

    ' Last Change: Wednesday 2002 Aug 14'  

The user can add additional specs, e.g. a g:timstamp_3 etc... :

    :let g:timstamp_3='\( Last messed up at:\).*$\1 %Y %b %d'

for those files that are still in early development? :-)
    

Note that the first empty or not existing spec will terminate processing.

If e.g. a g:timstamp_3 has been defined, but g:timstamp_2 has been set to "" 
processing will not continue beyond g:timstamp_2. On the other hand, if the
first two specs are non empty (either while they have not been overruled, or 
as they have been replaced by a non empty value), processing will continue 
with g:timstamp_3, g:timstamp_4, g:timstamp_5 ... as long as each consecutive 
variable exists and has a non empty value.

4.2. g:timstamp_automask				*timstamp_automask*

By default, the plugin installs an "autocommand BufWrite" for all files. So it
uses '*' as {pat} (cfr |:autocmd|). The user can overrule this behaviour by
defining g:timstamp_automask with the desired value, e.g.:

    :let g:timstamp_automask = "*.html"
>
to limit timestamping to html files.

4.3. g:timstamp_hostname			    Cfr |timstamp_hostname|.

4.4. g:timstamp_Hostname			    Cfr |timstamp_Hostname|.

4.5. g:timstamp_ignorecase				*timstamp_ignorecase*

The plugin ignores case when performing the eventual substitution. 
So ' lAsT cHanGe:' is as valid as ' Last Change:'. The user can prevent this
by defining global variable g:timstamp_ignorecase to an empty value: <

    :let g:timstamp_ignorecase = ""
>

4.6. g:timstamp_language				*timstamp_language*

The plugin assumes that one usually wants english timestamps. By default it
executes a ':language time en' to achieve this. The user can specify a
different language to be used by means of the g:timstamp_language variable.


4.7. g:timstamp_modelines				*timstamp_modelines*

The plugin uses the value of the |'modelines'| option to define the number of
head or tail lines to be taken into account. The user can specify a different
value by means of the g:timstamp_modelines variable. 

This can even be set to '$' if all file lines have to be taken into account.
Be aware that this would change any line that matches any of your
|timspec_specs|. This may be more than you would expect.

4.8. g:timstamp_userid				    Cfr |timstamp_userid|

4.9. g:timstamp_username			    Cfr |timstamp_username|
